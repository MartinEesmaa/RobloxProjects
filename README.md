# Story about my projects

In Estonia, I started to make my Roblox projects after sign up Roblox account, when I was nearly 10 years old. 

My first project was called about: PinMartin892's Place and I start to put something objects to my project.

After making fun for my first project, I realised I was kinda bored and nothing to do with my first project. The first project was created 6th May 2015 and was last updated at 16th September 2015.

3 years later... In 2018, I started the second project called "Brick break" and all I do is create more bricks. 

After making bricks, I tested it out for car smashes to brick, but it was very hard to make one piece rigibody and car didn't smash well. 

My projects were failed and I decided to quit for making Roblox projects anymore.

Now, I decided to release my roblox projects into my repository, so you can have look my projects.
